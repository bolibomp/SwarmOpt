# Swarm Optimization

This is a program from optimizing functions using swarm optimization. Swarm optimization is basically that you randomly initiate several "solutions" to your problem to create the swarm. Each "solution" in the swarm has a velocity that will determine where the “solution” will "land" the next iteration. The "solution" remembers its best location (in terms of the objective function) but can also so its neighbors best position. Its velocity is updated each time step based on this knowledge.
